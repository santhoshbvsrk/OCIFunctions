This is an OCI Function code written in Python to call OIC Integration with Single Input & Multiple Output parameters.

Once you deploy Function in OCI using this, you need to create configuration variables on that function, where you need to Key-In OICIntegrationURL, Username & Password.
If you want to pass these values dynamically then update the code in func.py by not considering them as cfg variables.
